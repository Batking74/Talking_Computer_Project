# Talking Computer Project

I decided to build this project in 2021 to get more practice using HTML, CSS, and JS.
I use this project whenever I dont feel like reading a long paragraph or I just want someone to read for me.

## This project does the following
  - Reads whatever text you want it to read outloud
  - You can adjust the speed at which the speechsynthesis is talking
  - You can pause the speechsynthesis and stop it from reading text

### Technologies Used
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
