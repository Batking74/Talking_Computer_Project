# Talking Computer Project

I decided to build this project in 2021 to get more practice using HTML, CSS, and JS.

This project does the following:
  - Reads whatever text you want it to read outloud
  - You can adjust the speed at which the speechsynthesis is talking
  - You can pause the speechsynthesis and stop it from reading text

I use this project whenever I dont feel like reading a long paragraph or I just want someone to read for me

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
