# Talking Computer Project

### Description
In the year 2021, I undertook the challenge of building this project to further refine my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JS. This endeavor not only provided valuable practice but also became a practical solution for times when I'd rather avoid delving into lengthy paragraphs or when I simply prefer having the content read aloud. The project stands as a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement in web development, combining technical skill enhancement with the creation of a functional and user-friendly tool for personalized convenience.
